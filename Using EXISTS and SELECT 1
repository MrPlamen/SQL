Checking for Existence of Rows

In conditional logic, especially in stored procedures or functions, you might want to check if rows exist that satisfy a certain condition. 
Using SELECT 1 can be more efficient than selecting all columns.

IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10) THEN
  -- Do something if there are employees in department 10
END IF;
